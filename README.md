# Rube Goldberg Challenge - High Immersion Specialization (Project 1)
![Alt text](/Screenshots/Screenshot.png?raw=true "Gameplay")

## Overview
This project was a chance for me to create my first fully-functional multi-platform high-immersion VR game. The goal of this project was to create a Rube Goldberg game that challenges players to create contraptions that solve physics puzzles.

First I imported SteamVR and set up up my scene environment. Then my task was to add locomotion, grabbing physics, and a menu system. With the core components built, I then imported the Oculus SDK and created Oculus versions of my code. Lastly I used my creativity to create a number of unique objects and levels.

## Some Challenges

One of my most notable challenges was preventing the player from being able to teleport outside the map.

## Skills utilized
This project was about combining various ideas and skills I've been practicing throughout the course. They include:

* Adding SteamVR and the Oculus SDK to a Unity Project
* Designing gameplay for 6DOF hand controllers
* Creating teleport or similar locomotion mechanics
* Creating object grabbing and throwing code
* Creating a menu system with hand controllers and Vector2 input
* Creating seamless VR scene loading
* Designing anti-cheat mechanisms
* Integrating SteamVR and Oculus input handling in the same project
* Creating dynamic 3D objects
